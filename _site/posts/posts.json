Final VisualizationMain Observations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis post was written as part of requirements for Visual Analytics course in MITB.\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\nFor many countries, Singapore serves as an important port for trades and also heavily rely on imported goods for the country’s usage. Trades primarily consist of imports and exports, where imports refer to goods brought into Singapore irrespective of the uses, while exports refer to goods brought out of the country. In order to understand the movement of goods in Singapore, data visualization is important to help us discover meaningful insights that could potentially drive better decision-making and improvement of Singapore’s trades.\r\nIn this post, the original visualization chart of Singapore’s Merchandise Trade from SingStat will be critically reviewed and an improved alternative design will be proposed.\r\n2. Evaluation\r\nThe original chart is as shown below, and it mainly consists of top 6 trading countries between a time period of 2019-2021. The graphs were plotted based on their exports and imports across the time period.\r\nFigure 2.1: Original Chart from SingstatBefore evaluating the chart, primary research on the visualization was conducted in order to understand what are the purposes of this graph as well as key takeaways for the readers.\r\nAudience: Government Agencies, policy-makers, businesses and individuals\r\nPurpose: To have a clear overview on changes in trade volume (between exports and imports) of Singapore and its top 6 countries between 2019 to 2021, especially since it was during the Covid-19 pandemic.\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nS/N\r\nCritique\r\nApproach\r\n1\r\nCell 3\r\n\r\n2\r\nCell 4\r\n\r\n2.2 Aesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nCritique\r\nApproach\r\n1\r\nCell 3\r\n\r\n2\r\nCell 4\r\n\r\n3. Proposed Visualization Design\r\n3.1 Sketched Design\r\nFigure 3.1.1: New Proposed Design on Sketch3.2 Advantages of New Design\r\nAble to see the distinct changes in exports and imports trade volume per country\r\n4. Step-by-Step Methodology\r\n4.1 Data Source\r\nThe raw excel data was downloaded from SingStat, and a preview of how the data looks like is shown below.\r\nFigure 4.1.1: Singapore Exports from 1976Figure 4.1.2: Singapore Imports from 1976As observed, the data was dated back from 1976 till 2021 in monthly basis. There are also many missing data (represented by “na”) and unnecessary top few rows.\r\n4.2 Data Preparation\r\nTo facilitate ease of data preparation, the raw dataset will first be uploaded onto Tableau Prep Builder for data selection. The steps noted below are based on table T1 (Imports Table), but the same steps can be applied for table T2 (Exports Table) as well.\r\nS/N\r\nTableau Prep Builder Description\r\n1\r\nClick on “Connect data”, followed by “Microsoft Excel” to upload the raw dataset.\r\n2\r\nDrag table T1 into the empty pane.Notice that Tableau did not capture the headers and variables properly, hence we can click on “Use Data Interpreter” at the left side of the page. The final preview of the table shows the proper table inputs and field names.\r\n3\r\nNow, we can create a workflow for filtering of the data based on relevancy.At the top of the page, click on the “+” sign and select “Clean Step”.The preview will now show the interpreter data table.\r\n4\r\nSince the original chart only focuses on top 6 countries, we should filter the countries accordingly too.At the variables column, select the “More Options”, followed by “Filter” and “Selected Values”. We will then select the countries accordingly (including the total trades) as shown in the diagram above.\r\n5\r\nIn addition, the data of interest ranges from 2019 onwards. Hence, we will select only the fields from “2019 Jan” to “2021 Apr” and remove the rest using the “Remove Fields” button on top. The final preview of the table is as shown below. \r\n6\r\nFinally, the table shows no “null” values and thus we can save this table into an external xlsx file for further exploration on Tableau Desktop. At the top, click on the “+” sign and select “Output”.  Select “xlsx” as the output type and navigate to the directory where you wish to save the file at.\r\n\r\nTable 4.2.1: Tableau Prep Builder Steps\r\nRepeat the same steps as above for the Export Table. For easier reference, we shall combine both Imports.xlsx and Exports.xlsx into one excel worksheet before uploading into Tableau Desktop.\r\nS/N\r\nTableau Desktop Description\r\n1\r\nImport the dataset into Tableau Desktop and drag the tables into the empty space as shown below.\r\n2\r\nTo facilitate cross-referencing in the graphs later, we will create a “Union” between the 2 tables. Click on the “New Union” at the side bar and drag in both Import and Export tables.Click “ok” and the output will look like the diagram below, which both tables values together. \r\n3\r\nNext, we will make the dates as rows by pivoting for the table. Select all the dates and right click followed by “Pivot”. The table will now look like this: We will then rename the column names accordingly by double clicking at the headers for easier reference. \r\n4\r\nNotice that the dates are in strings data type based on the tiny label “Abc” on the top left corner at the columns. In this case, we will convert the data type into “Date” format in both Export and Import. \r\n5\r\nWe can also change the data type of the Variables column from strings to country, as it might be easier for us to conduct geospatial mapping later. To do so, click on the “Abc” logo again and hover on the “Geographical role” to select on “Country/Region”. \r\n6\r\nIn addition, we can see that only America is expressed in Million Dollars (SGD), while the rest are in Thousands. Hence, we will convert all the values into the same units (Billion Dollars) since the numbers are relatively large. Select the values column and right click on the “Calculated Field” function.  Based on a brief scan across the table, it shows that America values are less than 5 figures, hence we can enter the syntax as this: After applying the changes, our table values now looks better. We shall rename the column names as well. \r\n7\r\nNow, we will rename the variables to make it shorter and easier to read. Select the variables column and right click on “Aliases”.A second window will pop up, and double click on the _“Value (Alias)” to edit the names accordingly. \r\n8\r\nAfter all the above steps, the final overview of the tables should look something like this: \r\n\r\nTable 4.2.2: Tableau Desktop Steps\r\nThe table is now ready to be used for constructing of visualizations.\r\n4.3 Data Visualization (First Chart: Trade Volume and Balance)\r\nIn this first chart, we will be creating a line and bar chart congregated onto a single axis for an easier overview in both trade volumes and balance between exports and imports.\r\nSetting up of Plot\r\nOpen up the first sheet tab of Tableau, and we can see the Tables Pane like this:\r\nFigure 4.3.1: Setting up worksheet in TableauDrag variables “Country”, “Date” and “SGD (Billion)” into the “Columns” and “Rows”, and you can see the plot as follows:\r\nFigure 4.3.2: Inputting Variables to plotNote that the date of interest is from 2019-2020, and only the top 6 countries to be selected. Hence, we will do a “Filters”, by dragging in “Country” and “Date” into there. We will de-select on “Total Exports” and “Total Imports” for the “Country”, while de-selecting “2021” option in the Years for “Date”. We will then click on “Apply” and the changes will occur accordingly.\r\n\r\nFigure 4.3.3: Filtering VariablesFigure 4.3.4: Filtering Timeline\r\nNext, we will change the graph into a bar chart by selecting it from the “Marks” pane. We will also change the formatting for “Date” from the drop down by clicking on the “+” sign next to “Date” again to display the quarters as well. Hence, the steps and plot becomes like this:\r\n\r\nFigure 4.3.5: Bar ChartFigure 4.3.5: Altering the timelineFigure 4.3.5: Output of Bar Chart after changes to timeline\r\nIn order to plot both exports and imports on the same axis, we have to create a calculated field (right click at the left pane) as shown below in Figure 4.3.6. We will then replace the rows from “SGD (Billion)” to the new calculated field “Balance”. After that, drag the “Type” variable into the “Color” at Marks pane and we will get the diverging graph.\r\n\r\nFigure 4.3.6: Creating calculated fieldFigure 4.3.7: Formula used in the calculated fieldFigure 4.3.8: Output after manipulation - Vertical Diverging Graph\r\nNow, we will add in the line graph that calculates the trade balance onto the same plot.\r\nDrag the “Balance” variable into the rows and change it into a line graph.Then, right click on the botton axis and click on “Dual Axis”.\r\nWe will also synchronize the axis to re-organize the chart by right clicking the axis.\r\nIn case the line graph doesn’t show, we can realign the order by formatting the axis and selecting the marks to be brought forwards.\r\nViola! We have our combined diverging chart ready! You can change the colours of the lines/bar graph to make it more prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4.3.9: Creating Dual Axis with Line Graph #1Figure 4.3.10: Creating Dual Axis with Line Graph #2Figure 4.3.11: Creating Dual Axis with Line Graph #3Figure 4.3.12: Creating Dual Axis with Line Graph #4Figure 4.3.12: Output of Line and Bar Graphs together on same axis\r\nCustomization\r\nTo distinguish the important features of the graph, we will change the colours or formatting to make the features more prominent and pleasing to the eye. There are 4 main features to go about: \r\nEditing the title of axes and adding in labels, markers:\r\nDrag the “Balance” variable into the “Label” portion at the Marks for line graph.\r\nAdd in markers (under “Color”) to the lines for better identification.\r\nEdit the axes title by double clicking it.\r\n\r\nChange the colours of the bar chart to colours that are more pleasing to the eye.\r\nAdd in differentiating colours for negative and positive values in the trade balance by dragging “Balance” to “Color” in the Marks pane. Edit the colors into 2 steps that centered at 0, as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4.3.13: Creating 2-stepped color\r\nChanging the labels on the axis to positive values:\r\nAs imports are positive values originally, we will it on the axis. Firstly, right click on either axis to format it.\r\nUnder the “Axis” section, select the “Numbers”, click “Custom” and enter the format as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4.3.14: Reformatting axis to become all positive\r\nEdit the “Tooltip” to reflect the timeline, units, trade volume and balance.\r\nAfter all the steps above, the final chart is as shown below:\r\nFigure 4.3.15: Final Output of First Chart4.4 Data Visualization (Second Chart: Net Trade Volume)\r\nThis chart will be a simple visualization to the net exports and imports per year across the different countries.\r\nSetting up of Plot\r\nOpen up an empty sheet and drag in “Country”, “Date” to columns while “Type” into the rows. Leave the dates as yearly values.\r\nAs usual, filter the years to 2019-2020 and remove both “Total Exports” and “Total Imports”.\r\nNote that a table of missing values is now created, thus we will drag in “SGD (Billion)” to the “Text” section in the Marks pane.\r\nTo create colours in visualizing the change of net trade volume, we will be switching to a highlight table instead. On the top right corner of the page, click on “Show Me” and select the “Highlight Table” as shown in the diagram below.\r\n\r\nFigure 4.4.1: Changing chart type to Highlighted Table\r\nGreat! Our second chart is almost done, just need to touch up on the colours and display!\r\nCustomization\r\nSimilar to the first chart, we would like our visuals to highlight the key features.\r\nChange the colours of the table.\r\nAt the Marks pane, edit the “SGD (Billion)” under “Colors” and compute using the difference across pane.\r\nWe will be using the full spectrum of the diverging colours by checking the “Use Full Color Range”.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4.4.2: Computing difference across pane #1Figure 4.4.3: Computing difference across pane #2Figure 4.4.4: Creating diverging colors to show the differences\r\nAdding in Subtotals and Grand Totals\r\nTo show the overall values, we can add in the totals by clicking onto the tab “Analysis”, followed by “Totals” and selecting the “Add All Subtotals” as well as “Show Row Grand Totals”.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4.4.5: Addition of Subtotals and Grand Totals to the Table\r\nRename the axes and title of the chart for better understanding. After all the steps above, the final chart is shown below:\r\nFigure 4.4.6 Net Trade Volume4.5 Dashboard\r\nFinally, we can compile all the charts into the dashboard.\r\nFirst, open up an empty dashboard and set the size of it to “Automatic”.\r\n\r\nFigure 4.5.1: Empty New Dashboard pageFigure 4.5.2: Setting the size of Dashboard\r\nDrag in both sheets into the empty dashboard. Make sure to format the layout of all the charts as well as the legends and text into “Floating”. This will allow to resize and reorganize our dashboard easily.\r\n\r\nFigure 4.5.3: Creating “Floating” Charts and Diagrams\r\nInclude a header for the dashboard by checking the “Show dashboard title”.\r\n\r\nFigure 4.5.4: Including Dashboard Header\r\nInclude captions, text or description. To do so, drag the “Text” object into the dashboard and format it to “Floating”. Edit the text accordingly to information or findings from the chart.\r\n5.
