## 1. Introduction
For many countries, Singapore serves as an important port for trades and also heavily rely on imported goods for the country's usage. Trades primarily consist of imports and exports, where imports refer to goods brought into Singapore irrespective of the uses, while exports refer to goods brought out of the country. In order to understand the movement of goods in Singapore, data visualization is important to help us discover meaningful insights that could potentially drive better decision-making and improvement of Singapore's trades.

In this post, the original visualization chart of Singapore's Merchandise Trade from [_SingStat_](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/singapore-international-trade) will be critically reviewed and an improved  alternate `interactive` design will be proposed.


## 2. Evaluation

The original chart is as shown below, where it consists of major trading regions (in picture shows top 10: China, Malaysia, United States, European Union, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong) between a time period of January 2011 to December 2020.

<center>

![Figure 2.1: Original Chart from Singstat](img/download.png){width=80%}

</center>

Before evaluating the chart, primary research on the visualization was conducted in order to understand what are the purposes of this graph as well as key takeaways for the readers.

* **Audience:** Government Agencies, policy-makers, businesses and individuals
* **Purpose:** To have a clear overview on which markets are the major net importers and exporters, as well as visualize the total trading volume with Singapore. The trade values used will be between a fixed time period of 2011 to 2020, as well as all trading markets with Singapore should be evaluated. The visualization will also be made interactive for selected views.



### 2.1 Clarity

|S/N | Critique | Approach |
|:-:|:--------------|:---------|
|1 | _**Unclear chart title.**_ From the screenshot, the chart title is missing but upon closer examination with the actual data source, the chart title states as "Merchandize Trade Performance with Major Trading Partners, 2020". As the study period is from 2011-2020, the title is incorrect to put as 2020 only. | We will include the correct timeline of the study period, from 2011-2020. |
|2 | _**Confusing use of circles**_ to represent size of the trade volume, as this causes lots of overlapping. In addition, the white circle in the middle cannot be used to clearly differentiate whether the region is a net importer or exporter. | We will be using distinctive bar graphs to better show the ranking in trade volume as well as differentiating net exporters and importers. |
|3 | _**Captions/Notes are misleading**_. It is positioned at the bottom of the graph and the captions does not match the graph. We cannot tell whats the trend like in 2009 and 2006, based on the screenshot caption. | We will be using a yearly filter that allow us to see how the trend changes over the years for better comparison. |
|4 | _**Unclear axis labels.**_ The position of the x- and y-axis labels are position at the origin which makes it unclear. In addition, there are missing units of the labels. | We will be positioning the labels in the center of graph, as well as adding units (in this case SGD Billion). |


### 2.2 Aesthetics

|S/N | Critique | Approach |
|:-:|:--------------|:---------|
|1 | _**Wrong choice of opaque colours used for the circles.**_ Because of the overlapping circles, the opaque colours make it worse as we can't see what's behind. In addition, the diagonal reference line is also covered and hard to tell where the white circle lies. | For the makeover, we will abstain from using circles to differentiate trade volume and thus overlapping chances are very slim so this issue won't be of concern. |
|2 | _**Small Font Size.**_ The font size for "Net Importers" and "Net Exporters" are very small and they are position right at the extreme corners of the graph, making it visually hard to read. | Instead of writing it down, we will be using a graph directly to show the regions that are net importers or net exporters. |
|3 | _**Hard to distinguish regions by colours.**_ The colours of some circles looks very similar, for instance, Thailand and EU. This could be misleading for the viewers. | We will use as wide range of colours for more distinct outlook. |



## 3. Proposed Visualization Design

![Figure 3.1: Draft Design of the Proposed New Visual](img/Proposed Draft.png)


### 3.2 Advantages of New Design

- Instead of using circle plots, we will be using bar/line graph and lollipop chart. This gives better visibility to see the size of trade volume across different regions and continents. There will not be any overlapping and the sizes are sorted in order, allowing us to better see the top trading partners.

- Instead of squeezing the net exporters and importers onto one graph with the trade volume, we will be seperating them. This will prevent any overlapping as well as better show the distinctive ranking of top regions based on the criteria we are interested in (trade volume, net exporter and net importer), since they may not be the same (eg. China is top in trade volume but neither a top exporter or importer).

- The new design includes many filters and highlighted features for a more interactive view. This also includes filtering the regions based on their continent. With this aspect, the viewer can see the countries of interest based on continent instead of searching through the mixture of regions.

- We will also be adding in descriptions and chart titles to better summarize what the plot wishes to see so that the viewer can better understand and fully interact with the plot.

## 4. Step-by-Step Methodology

### 4.1 Data Source

We will be using the same datasets of "import.csv" and "export.csv" as [DataViz Makeover #1](https://limjiahui.netlify.app/posts/2021-05-21-dataviz-makeover-1/). 


### 4.2 Data Preparation

As the raw dataset consists of multiple unwanted rows, columns and 'NA' values, we will be doing some pre-processing on **Tableau Desktop**. For the purpose of this interactive visualization, we will be using all trading markets in the dataset.


```{r table2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis', warnings=FALSE}
tabl <- "
| Steps | Description   | 
|:-:|:-----------------|
| 1 | Import the raw dataset into Tableau Desktop. From there, we can see 2 different tables - T1 and T2.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.1.png){width=50%}![Figure](img/4.2.2.png){width=50%}<br/>Click on _New Union_ and drag both T1 and T2 and select _Apply_. |
| 2 | The data table will be stacked and it should look something like this: <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.3.png){width=100%}<br/> Notice that the structure of the table is wrong, thus we can click on _Cleaned with Data Interpreter_ at the side pane and it will automatically detect the exact table structure.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.4.png){width=50%}<br/>The data table should now look like this:<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.5.png)<br/> | 
| 3 | We will now filter the dates to January 2011 to December 2020. Shift and hold to select all unwanted columns, right click and select _Hide_. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.8.png){width=60%}<br/> |
| 4 |  To convert the date columns to rows, we will use the _Pivot_ function by right clicking the selected columns. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.9.png){width=70%}<br/> We can then rename the pivoted columns accordingly. |
| 5 |  Then, we shall rename the variables to shorter words for simiplicity and uniformity. Initially, the namings of the regions are very long and inconsistent as shown below.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.11.1.png){width=80%}<br/> As there are many regions, it will take alot of time to rename all individually. Hence, we shall use the split function in Tableau. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.11.2.png){width=80%}<br/> Great! Now tableau has automatically seperate the units and the region names. At the top right hand of the column, click on the tiny triangle and select _Aliases_. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.10.png){width=60%}<br/> <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.11.3.png){width=90%}<br/> Now, we can check through the namings and rename those longer ones to their acronyms or shorter version. <br/>**Note:** There are few regions that requires some prior knowledge and research before renaming, eg. Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is a group of states together, and Democratic People's Republic of Korea is North Korea. <br/> The final names should look like this: <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.11.4.png){width=90%}<br/> We shall rename this new column as 'Markets'. |
| 7 | Also, we can rename the _Table Name_ to 'Type' and change the aliases from T1 and T2 to Exports and Imports accordingly.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.12.png){width=80%}<br/> |
| 8 | After _split_ function above, notice that the 2nd variable columns becomes like this: <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.16.png){width=80%}<br/> Hence, we shall filter those out to tidy up our table. At the top right corner of the page, click on _Add_ under _Filter_. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.17.png){width=70%}<br/> Select _Variables Split 2_ and check on the Million and Thousand only. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.18.png){width=70%}<br/> After that, click on Ok to apply. |
| 9 |  Note that the SGD values recorded are not consistent, where some are in SGD Millon Dollars, while the rest are in SGD Thousands. As the numbers are all big, we will standardize across all values to SGD Billion Dollars. Create a _Calculated Field_ from the mini triangle again. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.13.png){width=60%}<br/> We can enter the following formula to the field using if-else function and click _Apply_. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.19.png){width=90%}<br/> |
| 10 |  Lastly, we shall change the Data type for the Date, from strings to Datetime format. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.15.png){width=50%}<br/> |
"

cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

Viola! Our data is well-prepped and ready to be used for visual constructions.



### 4.3 Data Visualization (1st Chart)

For this first chart, we will be examining the net exports and imports trade value based on each individual markets, using a horizontal diverging lollipop chart. 

#### Setting up the Plot

1. Open up a fresh empty worksheet, and drag _Markets_ into _Rows_ and _Filters_ pane. Because we want to compare between the markets individually, we will filter out the Total Exports and Imports, as well as the Continents (Europe, Asia, America, Oceania, Africa). The filters should look like below, and once all is selected properly, click on _Apply_.

<center>

![Figure 4.3.1: Filtering Variables](img/4.3.1.png){width=50%}

</center>

2. Next, we will create a calculated field to show the net trade values. Right-click onto the Data pane and click on _Create Calculated Field_. We will use an if-else function to multiply the SGD value to negative if it its imports (aka sheet = 'T1'). Hence, we can apply the formula as shown in Fig 4.3.3 and rename it to "Net Trade Indicator".


<center>

![Figure 4.3.2: Creating Calculated Field](img/4.3.2.png){width=50%}

![Figure 4.3.3: Inputting if-else functions](img/4.3.3.png){width=75%}

</center>


3. Now, drag the "Net Trade Indicator" into the _Columns_, and you can see a diverging bar chart already. In order to make it a lollipop shape, we have to use dual axis. Drag "Net Trade Indicator" again to columns to create this effect, but change the marks as "Circle" instead and thus it should look something like Fig 4.3.4. 

<center>

![Figure 4.3.4: Creating dual axis with different markings](img/4.3.4.png)

</center>


4. Now, lets join them together into one axis. Right click on the x-axis and select on _Dual Axis_. After that, remember to _Synchronize Axis_ so that the plots appear together in sync.


<center>

![](img/4.3.5.png){width=30%}![](img/4.3.6.png){width=30%}

![Figure 4.3.5: Making into one axis and Synchronize](){width=0%}

</center>


5. Note that after combining them, the shapes of the chart might be different. Do make sure that one of them is a circle, while the other is a bar graph. You can make the changes under the individual Marks pane (do not change the All marks pane!).

<center>

![Figure 4.3.6: Making into one axis](img/4.3.7.png){width=30%}

</center>


6. Next, we shall alter the size and colour for the charts. For the lollipop shape, we need the bar graph to be very thin while the circle to be larger. We can make the necessary changes in its individual Marks pane as well, under _Size_ tab. We can also change the colours under _Color_ accordingly to make the stem and head more distinct. Once the changes has been made, we have achieved our lollipop shape!


<center>

![](img/4.3.8.png)![](img/4.3.9.png)

![Figure 4.3.7: Changing colours and sizes](){width=0%}

![Figure 4.3.8: Lollipop Shape](img/4.3.10.png){width=70%}

</center>


7. As the original purpose of the graph is to see Singapore's **Major** trading partners, we shall now create a parameter called "Top N Trading Partners". This parameter can also be used as a filter to change the N value based on what the viewer wish to see.
    + Right click at the Data Pane and select _Create Parameter_.
    + We shall create a list with integers from 5-20 with stepsize of 5.
    + In order to allow it to work as a filter for _Markets_ variable, we can edit the _Markets_ filter by navigating to the _Top_ tab and select the _By field_, changing it to the name of the parameter we just created.
    + As we are interested in filtering by **Total Sum of Imports and Exports value**, we can select that condition under _by_ drop down menu as well.


<center>

![Figure 4.3.10: Adding parameter into the filter](){width=0%}

</center>


8. Let us now tidy up our graphs but adding the directional colours, labels and filters. 
    + Firstly, we can change the colours based on the direction by dragging in "Net Trade Indicator" into the _Color_ tab for the **Circle** graph. Click on the colour legend and change it into two-step colours.
    + Then, we shall drag the "Net Trade Indicator" into the _Label_ tab for **Circle** graph and realign it to center.
    + As the numbers are quite long, we shall alter them into whole numbers for easier viewing. Right-click on the x-axis and select _Format_. Under the Default, we can customize the appearance of the numbers.
    + Lastly, we shall add our filters. Click on the parameter and select _Show Parameter_. We are also interested to see the changes across time, hence lets drag the _Date_ variable into the _Filters_ and display the years as a single value list while removing the "All" function.


<center>

![Figure 4.3.13: Adding filters](){width=0%}

</center>


9. To make our graph visibly clearer for readers, we shall add in a reference line as well as color-coded sections.
    + First, lets sort the plot in descending order by clicking the tiny bar right next to the x-axis title. Then, we can add the line by right clicking onto the x-axis and select _Add Reference Line_.
    + Edit the parameters by changing the value to a constant 0, dotted line, as well as filled colours as shown in Fig 4.3.15.


<center>

![Figure 4.3.14: Sorting graph descendingly and adding a reference line](img/4.3.23.png){width=40%}

![Figure 4.3.15: Editing appearance of reference line and graph](img/4.3.24.png){width=80%}

</center>


#### Inserting Tooltip

Let's now make the visual more interactive with the use of tooltips. We can edit the tooltip manually or by adding calculated fields.

1. First, we can create a calculated field that will differentiate net importers and exporters. Right-click on the data pane and select _Create Calculated Field_. Then, we can input the formula as shown below, naming it as _Net Trade_Type_:

<center>

![Figure 4.3.16: Calculated field for Tooltip](img/4.3.25.png){width=70%}

</center>


2. Drag this field into the _Tooltip_ tab under Marks pane, and click on the tab. We shall edit the tooltip by clicking onto _Insert_ and select the various fields highlighted. We can also further beautify the tooltip with bolding, colours and changing of font size etc. Our final edit will look similar to Fig 4.3.16.

<center>

![Figure 4.3.17: Inserting fields into Tooltip](img/4.3.26.png){width=70%}

![Figure 4.3.18: Overview of Tooltip](img/4.3.27.png){width=70%}

</center>



#### Final Graph

And now our first chart is done! After a few finishing touches (hiding the top axis, renaming chart title, sort in descending), our final static diverging lollipop graph will look like this:


![Figure 4.3.19: Final Static Lollipop Graph for Net Trade Value](img/Net Trade Value.png)



### 4.4 Data Visualization (2nd Chart)

Moving on to the second chart, this graph will visualize the overall performance of each trading partners with Singapore via the same scatterplot based on the original design, but improved. We will also be using the same parameter filter and year filter for this chart.

#### Setting up the Plot

1. Create an empty worksheet. Similarly, we will filter the continents as well as total exports and imports out to focus on trading partners only. To do so, drag _Markets_ into the _Filters_ pane. We can also add in the _Date_ into _Filters_ and also show the top N parameter as a filter as well, similar to the above chart.

2. Create an empty worksheet. Next, we shall generate two calculated fields, one for exports and the other for imports. We can simply divide them based on an if-else function for calculated fields as shown below.

<center>

![](img/4.4.1.png){width=50%}![](img/4.4.2.png){width=50%}

![Figure 4.4.1: Calculations for Imports and Exports](){width=0%}

</center>


3. After creating the calculated fields, drag in _Exports_ to the _Columns_ and _Imports_ to the _Rows_. Noticed that only one dot appear on the chart, hence we shall drag in _Markets_ to the _Detail_ tab at the Marks Pane. The chart should finally look like something below (with the filters and parameter as well).


<center>

![Figure 4.4.2: Scatterplot](img/1.1.png){width=80%}

</center>


4. Let's tidy up this graph. 
    + Firstly, let's change the shape of the graph to circles by clicking at the Marks pane. We shall also add in labels of the country for the circles by dragging in the _Markets_ to _Label_ tab.
    + Next, we would like to edit the scale of the x-axis and y-axis. We shall follow the same scale of 80 Billion based on the original graph. A quick scan through the years also validate that 80 billion for both axis suffice. We can do so by right-clicking onto either axis, select _Edit Axis_, _Fixed_ and change to 0 and 80 accordingly. Repeat the same for the other axis.
    + Let's also edit the x- and y- axis names to include the units (SGD Billion) so that we won't have to put it into our labels. Likewise, right click to _Edit Axis_.


<center>

![](img/1.2.png){width=20%}![](img/1.3.png){width=40%}

![Figure 4.4.3: Formatting Chart](){width=0%}


![](img/1.4.png){width=20%}![](img/1.5.png){width=40%}![](img/1.6.png){width=40%}

![Figure 4.4.4: Editing x- and y- axis (same methods)](){width=0%}

</center>


5. Next, we shall add in a reference line to differentiate the net exporter and net importer.
    + Firstly, lets create a calculated field, say for the _Exports_. We shall name it _Reference Line_.
    + Drag the _Reference Line_ into the _Rows_, next to _Imports_.
    + Notice how they appear to be in a straight line? Let's change the shape of this to make it into a _Line_ using the Marks Pane.
    + Next, we edit the reference line y-axis to fix it the same with our plot, 0-80.
    + We shall then make the line extend to the origin. At any point on the line, right click, select _Trend Lines_ and _Show Trend Lines_. Then, select the one that extends and hit 0.
    + We can also click on _Edit Trendline_ and check the _Force Intercept to 0_.
    + After that, we can see that the original line is still in place. To remove it, we can change the opacity to 0% from the Marks pane.
    + Good! Now let's make the line onto the same axis by using _Dual Axis_ and _Synchronize Axis_.


<center>

![](img/1.7.png){width=50%}![](img/1.8.png){width=40%}

![](img/1.11.png){width=30%}![](img/1.12.png){width=30%}

![Figure 4.4.7: Putting the line onto the same graph](){width=0%}

</center>


6. Now, lets make our plot more clear in its aim. We wish to use the plot to try and show who are the net importers and exporters in general, as well as their trade volume.
    + First, let's drag in the calculated field from the first chart, _Net Trade Indicator_, into the _Color_ tab from Marks Pane. We shall edit the colours to make it two-stepped and with the middle as 0.
    + As we want the circles to not be opaque in the event of overlapping, we can edit the opacity in the Marks pane, as well as adding a white border to distinguish.


<center>

![Figure 4.4.8: Creating colours to indicate distinct comparison](img/1.13.png){width=40%}

![Figure 4.4.9: Reducing opacity and putting white border](img/1.15.png){width=40%}

</center>


7. In order to make our graph more interactive, we shall add in an additional filter (that will also be used with the above chart simultaneously) that allow the users to choose the continent. Each continent will also contain the respective countries and regions, which can be found [_HERE_](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_continents).
    + To do so, we will need to use the _Group_ function and manually group them accordingly.
    + With reference to the link, we can group all regions into 5 continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, America and Oceania. Those that does not fit will be pushed to "-" category which we won't be touching at all.
    + Eventually, we will want to achieve something like Fig. 4.4.4.Rename the column as _Continents_.
    
<center>

![](img/4.4.6.png){width=30%}![](img/4.4.7.png){width=50%}

![Figure 4.4.10: Grouping into 5 continents](img/4.4.8.png){width=50%}

</center>


8. Next, we would want to add in this grouped data as a filter. Drag _Continents_ into the _Filters_. As we want to allow _Top N Trading Partners_ filter to be used together with the _Continents_ filter, click on the mini triangle of the _Continents_ filter and select _Add to Context_. Viola!! The top N partners shown will be based on the continents selected.


<center>

![Figure 4.4.11: Linking up both "Continents" and "Top N Trading Partners" filters](img/4.4.9.png){width=40%}

</center>

9. Lastly, let's create a ranking system that shows us the total trade volume of each markets across the continents. 
    + Firstly, we create an a calculated field using the RANK() function for our _Total (SGD Billion)_. Let name it as _Rank_.
    + Then, we drag _Rank_ to the _Label_ tab for the circles plot. Since we want it to be ranked across markets per continent, we will go to _Edit Table Calculations_ and edit to _Select Dimensions_ by _Markets_.

<center>

![](img/1.16.png){width=50%}![](img/1.17.png){width=40%}

![Figure 4.4.12: Creating ranking system](){width=0%}

</center>


#### Insert ToolTip

Similarly, we would want to let our tooltips give a brief summary of the graphs.

1. As currently we don't see the value of total trade for each markets in the tooltip, we can do so by dragging the _Total (SGD Billion)_ into _Tooltip_ tab in the Marks pane. Then click that tab, select _Insert_ and click on _Total (SGD Billion)_.

2. Click onto the tooltip for the scatterplot and edit it to the style you wish for it to see. One sample of the final output is shown below in Fig 4.4.14.

<center>

![](img/1.20.png){width=30%}![](img/1.21.png){width=60%}

![Figure 4.4.13: Inserting total trade value into Tooltip and editing style](){width=0%}


</center>


#### Final Graph

Finally, we are done with the second chart! After some minor touch ups (renaming title, edit colours), the chart should look something like this:

![Figure 4.4.7: Final Static Scatterplot](img/Scatterplot.png)


### 4.5 Dashboard

Finally, lets compile all of our charts into the dashboard and make some final adjustments to the interactive portions.

1. Create an empty dashboard and drag in the "Scatterplot" and "Net Trade Value" worksheets. For this dashboard, we will be using a fixed size of _Generic Desktop (1366 x 168)_ due to the volatility of the net trade value which will cause some compression if sizing is set to automated. We will also check the _Show Dashboard title_ and drag in _Blank_ or _Text_ objects to create spaces and captions.

<center>

![](img/4.5.1.png){width=40%}![](img/4.5.2.png){width=50%}

![Figure 4.5.1: Defining the sizing and dragging in tools for constructions](){width=00%}

</center>


2. After dragging the charts in and arrange them side-by-side, we would want to alter the filters to ensure that it applies to both charts together. Right click on each filter, go to _Apply to Worksheets_ and either choose _All Using This Data Source_ or select the worksheets on the dashboard.

<center>

![Figure 4.5.2: Formatting the filters to be applied for both charts](img/4.5.3.png){width=60%}

</center>


3. Next, let's do some **highlighting** to make the visual more interactive.
    + First, lets make sure that the legend can be highlighted so that the bar and line graph can be shown distinctly.
    + Next, we will create a _Highlight_ from _Actions_ using _Markets_ as selected fields for both "Trade Value" and "Net Trade Value".


<center>

![Figure 4.5.3: Highlighting of legend](img/4.5.4.png){width=45%}


![](img/4.5.5.png){width=40%}![](img/4.5.6.png){width=40%}

![Figure 4.5.4: Creating Highlighted Action](img/4.5.7.png){width=50%}

</center>


4. Notice that when we click onto the filters, the transitions are not very smooth? We can fix that by adding in _Animations_ from the _Format_ tab, followed by turning _On_ the workbook default.

<center>

![](img/4.5.8.png){width=40%}![](img/4.5.9.png){width=40%}

5. Next, we will add in an info icon that will display useful information when hovered. This is not only an interactive feature, but also due to dashboard constraints, we can add in more information via the hover function.
    + Create an empty worksheet and rename it to "Info".
    + Create a calculated field and we will type in "Info". Apply the calculation.
    + Drag _Info_ into the _Rows_ pane. Right click on the sheet to hide away the title and header.
    + We will then change the Marks Pane to _Shape_, followed by clicking onto the _Shape_ tab to select the type of shape we want.
    + We can further format the sheet by removing the gridlines as well as changing the background colour by right-clicking select _Format_.
    + To make it hoverable with the correct information, we shall edit the _Tooltip_ accordingly.
    + Hence, the **final** text format for this icon should look something like in Fig 4.5.8.

6. Next, we shall include a graphical illustration into the hover information. To do so, we need to create a new graph from a new worksheet.
    + Drag _Date_ and _Measure Values_ into the _Columns_ and _Rows_ pane respectively. 
    + Remove unwanted measured values so that only _Exports_, _Imports_ and _Total (SGD Billion)_ are left in the graph.
    + We shall annotate the graph, such that the lines are distinct. Drag the _Measure Names_ and _Measure Values_ into the _Label_ tab. We can also drag in _Measure Names_ to the _Color_ tab to allow colours to distinguish the different trade types.
    + As we notice fluctuations at 2016 and 2018, we shall add in reference lines at those points. First, we change the _Date_ type to continuous and then right-click on the axis to _Add Reference Line_.
    + Select the value to be a _Constant_ and the date to be at the beginning of the respective year (eg. 1/1/2016). We can display the label to be the constant value and format the line to dotted as well as thinner line.
    + The final overview should look something like Fig 4.5.13.

7. After that, to include this graph into the tooltip, we shall go to the "Info" sheet's tooltip, select _Insert_, _Sheets_ and click onto the line graph.

8. Finally, let's input this hover icon into the dashboard.
    + Drag in the "Info" sheet into the dashboard and change the format to _Floating_ so that we can position it to where we want.
    + Hide away the title of the sheet.
    + Let's also include a caption by dragging in the _Text_ object, making it floating as well and edit it accordingly.

Well done!! We are now set up for the visualization and ready to evaluate the observations we see! 


## 5. Final Visualization

The final visualization screenshot is as shown below, and the interactive version can be accessed [_HERE_](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lim.jiahui/viz/dataviz2_v2/FinalDashboard).

### Main Observations

1. **Overall observations**:
    + From 2011-2020, the top 20 trading partners are mainly located in the Asia Continent. 
    + Overall trend in trade dips in 2016 and increases sharply in 2018. The dip might be due to [worldwide events](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/wts2016_e/WTO_Chapter_03_e.pdf), such as economic slowdown in China, falling oil prices and lower demand in Asia.
    + In addition, the increase might be affiliated to the implementation of Trans-Pacific Agreement. [WTO](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/wts2018_e/wts2018_e.pdf) research shows that increased spending mainly from US (with reference to the agreemnt) and rising consumption rate from Japan has contributed to strong growth in trades from 2017-2018.

2. **Top Trading Partner(s)**: China (2013-2020), Malaysia (2011-2012)
    + As Malaysia is Singapore's nearest neighbour, it is no surprise that the trade volume of Malaysia is generally within the Top 5 rank across the years.
    + Malaysia was ranked 1st in 2011, but China eventually took over from 2013 onwards. The sudden increase from China might be due to the Singapore-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA) amendment in 2011 and China's ever-growing economy and demand from manufactured goods. 
    + Interestingly, the FTA from [here](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/non-financial-assistance/for-singapore-companies/free-trade-agreements/ftas/singapore-ftas/csfta) states that new benefits were added to the FTA from late 2019, which should cause the trade with China to be better, but the trade volume slightly decrease from SGD 137B in 2019 to SGD 136B in 2020. This might coincide with the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan during Dec 2019 and eventually causes country-wide lockdown in China.


3. <span style="color:green">**Top Net Exporter**</span>: Hong Kong
    + Hong Kong has been Singapore's top exporter from 2011-2020, where the average exports volume remains stable at around SGD 50 billion. The highest trade surplus recorded was in 2018, with a surplus value of SGD 60B.  


4. <span style="color:red">**Top Net Importer**</span>: US (from 2011-2017),Taiwan from (2018-2020)
    + In 2011-2017, the trade deficit value of US slowly increases from SGD -20B to SGD -15B, holding the top importer position until 2018 where Taiwan took over with a trade deficit of SGD -20B. The trade deficit value of Taiwan has then been decreasing since 2018 to 2020, hitting a new low of SGD -25B in 2020.
