## 1. Introduction
For many countries, Singapore serves as an important port for trades and also heavily rely on imported goods for the country's usage. Trades primarily consist of imports and exports, where imports refer to goods brought into Singapore irrespective of the uses, while exports refer to goods brought out of the country. In order to understand the movement of goods in Singapore, data visualization is important to help us discover meaningful insights that could potentially drive better decision-making and improvement of Singapore's trades.

In this post, the original visualization chart of Singapore's Merchandise Trade from [_SingStat_](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/singapore-international-trade) will be critically reviewed and an improved alternative design will be proposed.


## 2. Evaluation

The original chart is as shown below, where it consists of 10 trading regions (China, Malaysia, United States, European Union, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong) between a time period of January 2011 to December 2020.

Before evaluating the chart, primary research on the visualization was conducted in order to understand what are the purposes of this graph as well as key takeaways for the readers.

* **Audience:** Government Agencies, policy-makers, businesses and individuals
* **Purpose:** To have a clear overview on the trade volume comparison between imports and exports of Singapore and the 10 countries between a fixed time period of 2011 to 2020.

## 4. Step-by-Step Methodology

### 4.1 Data Source

We will be using the same datasets of "import.csv" and "export.csv" as [DataViz Makeover #1](https://limjiahui.netlify.app/posts/2021-05-21-dataviz-makeover-1/). 


### 4.2 Data Preparation

As the raw dataset consists of multiple unwanted rows, columns and 'NA' values, we will be doing some pre-processing on **Tableau Desktop**.

S/N | Tableau Desktop Description 
----| ---------
1 | Import the raw dataset into Tableau Desktop. From there, we can see 2 different tables - "T1" and "T2".<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.1.png){width=50%}![Figure](img/4.2.2.png){width=50%}<br/>Click on _"New Union"_ and drag both "T1" and "T2" and select _"Apply"_.
2 | The data table will be stacked and it should look something like this: <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.3.png){width=100%}<br/> Notice that the structure of the table is wrong, thus we can click on _"Cleaned with Data Interpreter"_ at the side pane and it will automatically detect the exact table structure.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.4.png){width=50%}<br/><br/>![Figure](img/4.2.5.png){width=120%}<br/>

</center>


```{r table2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
