## 1. Introduction
For many countries, Singapore serves as an important port for trades and also heavily rely on imported goods for the country's usage. Trades primarily consist of imports and exports, where imports refer to goods brought into Singapore irrespective of the uses, while exports refer to goods brought out of the country. In order to understand the movement of goods in Singapore, data visualization is important to help us discover meaningful insights that could potentially drive better decision-making and improvement of Singapore's trades.

In this post, the original visualization chart of Singapore's Merchandise Trade from [_SingStat_](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/singapore-international-trade) will be critically reviewed and an improved alternative design will be proposed.


## 2. Evaluation

The original chart is as shown below, where it consists of 10 trading regions (China, Malaysia, United States, European Union, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong) between a time period of January 2011 to December 2020.

Before evaluating the chart, primary research on the visualization was conducted in order to understand what are the purposes of this graph as well as key takeaways for the readers.

* **Audience:** Government Agencies, policy-makers, businesses and individuals
* **Purpose:** To have a clear overview on the trade volume comparison between imports and exports of Singapore and the 10 countries between a fixed time period of 2011 to 2020.

## 4. Step-by-Step Methodology

### 4.1 Data Source

We will be using the same datasets of "import.csv" and "export.csv" as [DataViz Makeover #1](https://limjiahui.netlify.app/posts/2021-05-21-dataviz-makeover-1/). 


### 4.2 Data Preparation

As the raw dataset consists of multiple unwanted rows, columns and 'NA' values, we will be doing some pre-processing on **Tableau Desktop**.


```{r table2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis', warnings=FALSE}
tabl <- "
| Steps | Description   | 
|-----|:-------------:|
| 1 | Import the raw dataset into Tableau Desktop. From there, we can see 2 different tables - T1 and T2.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.1.png){width=50%}![Figure](img/4.2.2.png){width=50%}<br/>Click on _New Union_ and drag both T1 and T2 and select _Apply_. |
| 2 | The data table will be stacked and it should look something like this: <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.3.png){width=100%}<br/> Notice that the structure of the table is wrong, thus we can click on _Cleaned with Data Interpreter_ at the side pane and it will automatically detect the exact table structure.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.4.png){width=50%}<br/>The data table should now look like this:<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.5.png)<br/> | 
| 3 | Next, we will filter the countries from _Variables_ table to the 10 countries of interest. At the top right hand corner of the page, click on the _Add_ Filter.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.6.png){width=70%}<br/> Then, we will add the filter for _Variables_ and select the countries (including the total exports and imports) accordingly. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.7.png){width=70%}<br/> | 
| 4 | We will now filter the dates to January 2011 to December 2020. Shift and hold to select all unwanted columns, right click and select _Hide_. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.8.png){width=60%}<br/> |
| 5 |  To convert the date columns to rows, we will use the _Pivot_ function by right clicking the selected columns. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.9.png){width=70%}<br/> We can then rename the pivoted columns accordingly. |
| 6 |  Then, we shall rename the variables to shorter words. At the top right hand of the column, click on the tiny triangle and select _Aliases_. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.10.png){width=60%}<br/> We can then edit the names accordingly as shown below.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.11.png){width=80%}<br/> We can also rename the _Table Name_ to Exports and Imports accordingly.<br/>![Figure](img/4.2.12.png){width=80%}<br/> |
| 7 |  Note that only European Union is in SGD Millon Dollars, while the rest are in SGD Thousands. As the numbers are all big, we will standardize across all values to SGD Billion Dollars. Create a _Calculated Field_ from the mini triangle again. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.13.png){width=60%}<br/> Since the values for European Union are less than 5 digits, we can enter the following formula to the field and click _Apply_. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.14.2.png){width=90%}<br/> |
| 8 |  Lastly, we shall change the Data type for the Date, from strings to Datetime format. <br/>![Figure](img/4.2.15.png){width=50%}<br/> |
"

cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

Viola! Our data is well-prepped and ready to be used for visual constructions.
