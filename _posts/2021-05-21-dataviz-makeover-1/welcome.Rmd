## 1. Introduction
For many countries, Singapore serves as an important port for trades and also heavily rely on imported goods for the country's usage. Trades primarily consist of imports and exports, where imports refer to goods brought into Singapore irrespective of the uses, while exports refer to goods brought out of the country. In order to understand the movement of goods in Singapore, data visualization is important to help us discover meaningful insights that could potentially drive better decision-making and improvement of Singapore's trades.

In this post, the original visualization chart of Singapore's Merchandise Trade from [_SingStat_](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data) will be critically reviewed and an improved alternative design will be proposed.

## 2. Evaluation

The original chart is as shown below, and it mainly consists of top 6 trading countries between a time period of 2019-2021. The graphs were plotted based on their exports and imports across the time period.

```{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Original Chart'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/originalchart.png')
```

Before evaluating the chart, primary research on the visualization was conducted in order to understand what are the purposes of this graph as well as key takeaways for the readers.

* **Audience:** Government Agencies, policy-makers, businesses and individuals
* **Purpose:** To have a clear overview on changes in trade volume (between exports and imports) of Singapore and its top 6 countries between 2019 to 2021, especially since it was during the Covid-19 pandemic.

## 4. Step-by-Step Methodology

### 4.1 Data Source

The raw excel data was downloaded from SingStat, and a preview of how the data looks like is shown below. 

```{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Singapore Exports from 1976'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/exports_excel.png')
```

```{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Singapore Imports from 1976'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/imports_excel.png')
```

As observed, the data was dated back from 1976 till 2021 in monthly basis. There are also many missing data (represented by "na") and unnecessary top few rows.

### 4.2 Data Preparation

To facilitate ease of data preparation, the raw dataset will first be uploaded onto **Tableau Prep Builder** for data selection. The steps noted below are based on table T1 (Imports Table), but the same steps can be applied for table T2 (Exports Table) as well.

S/N | Description 
----| ---------
1 | ![](img/tabprep_connectDataMerged.png){width=500px} <br/>Click on _"Connect data"_, followed by _"Microsoft Excel"_ to upload the raw dataset.
2 | ![](img/tabprep_addData.png){#id .class height=40%} <br/>Drag table T1 into the empty pane.<br/>![](img/tabprep_preview1.png){#id .class height=30%} <br/>Notice that Tableau did not capture the headers and variables properly, hence we can click on _"Use Data Interpreter"_ at the left side of the page. <br/>![](img/tabprep_preview2.png){#id .class height=30%} <br/>The final preview of the table shows the proper table inputs and field names.
3 | Now, we can create a workflow for filtering of the data based on relevancy.<br/>![](img/tabprep_cleanstep1.png){#id .class height=55%} <br/>At the top of the page, click on the "+" sign and select _"Clean Step"_.<br/> ![](img/tabprep_cleanstep2.png){#id .class height=32.5%} <br/>The preview will now show the interpreter data table.
4 | Since the original chart only focuses on top 6 countries, we should filter the countries accordingly too.<br/> ![](img/tabprep_cleanstep3.png){#id .class height=55%} <br/>At the variables column, select the _"More Options"_, followed by _"Filter"_ and _"Selected Values"_. <br/> ![](img/tabprep_cleanstep4.png){#id .class height=55%} <br/>We will then select the countries accordingly (including the total trades) as shown in the diagram above.
5 | In addition, the data of interest ranges from 2019-2021. Hence, we will select only the fields from "2019 Jan" to "2021 Apr" and remove the rest using the _"Remove Fields"_ button on top. <br/> ![](img/tabprep_cleanstep5.png){#id .class height=35%} <br/>The final preview of the table is as shown below. <br/>![](img/tabprep_cleanstep6.png){#id .class height=35%} <br/>
6 | Finally, the table shows no "null" values and thus we can save this table into an external xlsx file for further exploration on **Tableau Desktop**. <br/>![](img/tabprep_output.png){#id .class height=65%} <br/>At the top, click on the "+" sign and select _"Output"_. <br/> ![](img/tabprep_output2.png){#id .class height=60%} <br/> Select _"xlsx"_ as the output type and navigate to the directory where you wish to save the file at.


Repeat the same steps as above for the Export Table. For easier reference, we shall combine both Imports.xlsx and Exports.xlsx into one excel worksheet before uploading into **Tableau Desktop**.
