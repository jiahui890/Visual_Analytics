## 1. Introduction
For many countries, Singapore serves as an important port for trades and also heavily rely on imported goods for the country's usage. Trades primarily consist of imports and exports, where imports refer to goods brought into Singapore irrespective of the uses, while exports refer to goods brought out of the country. In order to understand the movement of goods in Singapore, data visualization is important to help us discover meaningful insights that could potentially drive better decision-making and improvement of Singapore's trades.

In this post, the original visualization chart of Singapore's Merchandise Trade from [_SingStat_](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data) will be critically reviewed and an improved alternative design will be proposed.

## 2. Evaluation

The original chart is as shown below, and it mainly consists of top 6 trading countries between a time period of 2019-2021. The graphs were plotted based on their exports and imports across the time period.

```{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Original Chart'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/originalchart.png')
```

Before evaluating the chart, primary research on the visualization was conducted in order to understand what are the purposes of this graph as well as key takeaways for the readers.

* **Audience:** Government Agencies, policy-makers, businesses and individuals
* **Purpose:** To have a clear overview on changes in trade volume (between exports and imports) of Singapore and its top 6 countries between 2019 to 2021, especially since it was during the Covid-19 pandemic.

## 4. Step-by-Step Methodology

### 4.1 Data Source

The raw excel data was downloaded from SingStat, and a preview of how the data looks like is shown below. 

```{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Singapore Exports from 1976'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/exports_excel.png')
```

```{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Singapore Imports from 1976'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/imports_excel.png')
```

As observed, the data was dated back from 1976 till 2021 in monthly basis. There are also many missing data (represented by "na") and unnecessary top few rows.

### 4.2 Data Preparation

To facilitate ease of data preparation, the raw dataset will first be uploaded onto **Tableau Prep Builder** for data selection. The steps noted below are based on table T1 (Imports Table), but the same steps can be applied for table T2 (Exports Table) as well.

S/N | Tableau Prep Builder Description 
----| ---------
1 | ![](img/tabprep_connectDataMerged.png){width=500px} <br/>Click on _"Connect data"_, followed by _"Microsoft Excel"_ to upload the raw dataset.
2 | ![](img/tabprep_addData.png){width=500px} <br/>Drag table T1 into the empty pane.<br/>![](img/tabprep_preview1.png){width=600px} <br/>Notice that Tableau did not capture the headers and variables properly, hence we can click on _"Use Data Interpreter"_ at the left side of the page. <br/>![](img/tabprep_preview2.png){width=600px} <br/>The final preview of the table shows the proper table inputs and field names.
3 | Now, we can create a workflow for filtering of the data based on relevancy.<br/>![](img/tabprep_cleanstep1.png){width=400px} <br/>At the top of the page, click on the "+" sign and select _"Clean Step"_.<br/> ![](img/tabprep_cleanstep2.png){width=600px} <br/>The preview will now show the interpreter data table.
4 | Since the original chart only focuses on top 6 countries, we should filter the countries accordingly too.<br/> ![](img/tabprep_cleanstep3.png){width=500px} <br/>At the variables column, select the _"More Options"_, followed by _"Filter"_ and _"Selected Values"_. <br/> ![](img/tabprep_cleanstep4.png){width=500px} <br/>We will then select the countries accordingly (including the total trades) as shown in the diagram above.
5 | In addition, the data of interest ranges from 2019 onwards. Hence, we will select only the fields from "2019 Jan" to "2021 Apr" and remove the rest using the _"Remove Fields"_ button on top. <br/> ![](img/tabprep_cleanstep5.png){width=600px} <br/>The final preview of the table is as shown below. <br/>![](img/tabprep_cleanstep6.png){width=600px} <br/>
6 | Finally, the table shows no "null" values and thus we can save this table into an external xlsx file for further exploration on **Tableau Desktop**. <br/>![](img/tabprep_output.png){width=500px} <br/>At the top, click on the "+" sign and select _"Output"_. <br/> ![](img/tabprep_output2.png){width=500px} <br/> Select _"xlsx"_ as the output type and navigate to the directory where you wish to save the file at.


Repeat the same steps as above for the Export Table. For easier reference, we shall combine both Imports.xlsx and Exports.xlsx into one excel worksheet before uploading into **Tableau Desktop**.


S/N | Tableau Desktop Description 
----| ---------
1 | Import the dataset into Tableau Desktop and drag the tables into the empty space as shown below. <br/>![](img/tabDT_1.png){width=500px} <br/>
2 | To facilitate cross-referencing in the graphs later, we will create a _"Union"_ between the 2 tables. Click on the _"New Union"_ at the side bar and drag in both Import and Export tables.<br/>![](img/tabDTnew_2.png){width=400px} <br/>Click _"ok"_ and the output will look like the diagram below, which both tables values together. <br/>![](img/tabDTnew_2.2.png){width=500px} <br/>
3 | Next, we will make the dates as rows by pivoting for the table. Select all the dates and right click followed by _"Pivot"_. <br/>![](img/tabDTnew_3.1.png){width=500px} <br/>The table will now look like this: <br/>![](img/tabDTnew_3.2.png){width=500px} <br/>We will then rename the column names accordingly by double clicking at the headers for easier reference. <br/>
4 | Notice that the dates are in strings data type based on the tiny label _"Abc"_ on the top left corner at the columns. In this case, we will convert the data type into _"Date"_ format in both Export and Import. <br/>![](img/tabDTnew_4.1.png){width=400px} <br/>
5 | We can also change the data type of the Variables column from strings to country, as it might be easier for us to conduct geospatial mapping later. To do so, click on the _"Abc"_ logo again and hover on the _"Geographical role"_ to select on _"Country/Region"_. <br/>![](img/tabDTnew_4.2.png){width=400px} <br/>
6 | In addition, we can see that only America is expressed in Million Dollars (SGD), while the rest are in Thousands. Hence, we will convert all the values into the same units (Billion Dollars) since the numbers are relatively large. Select the values column and right click on the _"Calculated Field"_ function. <br/>![](img/tabDTnew_6.1.png){width=400px} <br/> Based on a brief scan across the table, it shows that America values are less than 5 figures, hence we can enter the syntax as this: <br/>![](img/tabDTnew_6.2.1.png){width=600px} <br/>After applying the changes, our table values now looks better. We shall rename the column names as well. <br/>
7 | Now, we will rename the variables to make it shorter and easier to read. Select the variables column and right click on _"Aliases"_.<br/>![](img/tabDTnew_7.1.png){width=500px} <br/>A second window will pop up, and double click on the _"Value (Alias)" to edit the names accordingly. <br/>![](img/tabDTnew_7.2.png){width=550px} <br/>
8 | After all the above steps, the final overview of the tables should look something like this: <br/>![](img/tabDTnew_8.1.png){width=550px} <br/>


The table is now ready to be used for constructing of visualizations.


### 4.3 Data Visualization (First Chart: Trade Volume and Balance)

In this first chart, we will be creating a line and bar chart congregated onto a single axis for an easier overview in both trade volumes and balance between exports and imports.

#### Setting up of Plot

1. Open up the first sheet tab of Tableau, and we can see the Tables Pane like this: <br/>![](img/tabviz1_1.png){width=550px} <br/>

2. Drag variables "Country", "Date" and "SGD (Billion)" into the _"Columns"_ and _"Rows"_, and you can see the plot as follows: <br/>![](img/tabviz1_2.png){width=550px} <br/> 

3. Note that the date of interest is from 2019-2020, and only the top 6 countries to be selected. Hence, we will do a _"Filters"_, by dragging in "Country" and "Date" into there. We will de-select on "Total Exports" and "Total Imports" for the "Country", while de-selecting "2021" option in the Years for "Date".<br/>![](img/tabviz1_3.png){width=550px} <br/> <br/>![](img/tabviz1_3.2.png){width=550px} <br/> We will then click on _"Apply"_ and the changes will occur accordingly.

4. Next, we will change the graph into a bar chart by selecting it from the _"Marks"_ pane. <br/>![](img/tabviz1_4.1.png){width=550px} <br/> We will also change the formatting for "Date" from the drop down.<br/>![](img/tabviz1_4.2.png){width=550px} <br/> Click on the "+" sign next to "Date" again to display the quarters as well. Hence, the plot becomes like this: <br/>![](img/tabviz1_4.3.png){width=550px} <br/>

5. In order to plot both exports and imports on the same axis, we have to create a calculated field (right click at the left pane) as shown below: <br/>![](img/tabviz1_5.1.1.png){width=320px}<br/><br/>![](img/tabviz1_5.1.png){width=600px} <br/> We will then replace the rows from "SGD (Billion)" to the new calculated field "Balance". After that, drag the "Type" variable into the "Color" at Marks pane and we will get the diverging graph. <br/>![](img/tabviz1_5.2.png){width=60px} <br/>

6. Now, we will add in the line graph that calculates the trade balance onto the same plot. Drag the "Balance" variable into the rows and change it into a line graph.<br/>![](img/tabviz1_6.1.png){width=600px} <br/>Then, right click on the botton axis and click on "Dual Axis".<br/>![](img/tabviz1_6.2.png){width=350px} <br/> We will also synchronize the axis to re-organize the chart by right clicking the axis. <br/>![](img/tabviz1_6.3.png){width=350px} <br/> In case the line graph doesn't show, we can realign the order by formatting the axis and selecting the marks to be brought forwards. <br/>![](img/tabviz1_6.4.png){width=350px} <br/>Viola! We have our combined diverging chart ready! You can change the colours of the lines/bar graph to make it more prominent. <br/>![](img/tabviz1_6.5.png){width=600px} <br/>


#### Customization

To distinguish the important features of the graph, we will change the colours or formatting to make the features more prominent and pleasing to the eye. There are 4 main features to go about: <br/>

1. Editing the title of axes and adding in labels, markers:
    + Drag the "Balance" variable into the _"Label"_ portion at the Marks for line graph. 
    + Add in markers (under _"Color"_) to the lines for better identification.
    + Edit the axes title by double clicking it.

2. Change the colours of the bar chart to colours that are more pleasing to the eye.
    + Add in differentiating colours for negative and positive values in the trade balance by dragging "Balance" to _"Color"_ in the Marks pane. Edit the colors into 2 steps that centered at 0, as shown below:<br/>![](img/tabviz1_7.1.png){width=300px, height=300px} <br/>

3. Changing the labels on the axis to positive values:
    + As imports are positive values originally, we will it on the axis. Firstly, right click on either axis to format it.
    + Under the _"Axis"_ section, select the _"Numbers"_, click _"Custom"_ and enter the format as shown below: <br/>![](img/tabviz1_7.2.png){width=300px, height=300px} <br/>

4. Edit the "Tooltip" to reflect the timeline, units, trade volume and balance.


After all the steps above, the final chart is as shown below: <br/>![](img/Trade Volume and Balance.png){width=600px} <br/>
